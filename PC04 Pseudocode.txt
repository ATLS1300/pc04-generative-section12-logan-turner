I want to make different shapes that somewhat resemble flowers with a color palette similar to such because I think it would make an interesting garden picture each time. I will use a polygon shape, star stamp, and star shape.


I chose to have the fill color, pen color, speed, and line thickness picked randomly from an array (colors) or range (speed & thickness) because it will produce unique flowers. I also have the individual shape locations set to a random range, but this range is very small so as to not draw the same flower in the same location each iteration while also still maintaining the appearance of a garden.
